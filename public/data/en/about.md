Iranian born and living in the Netherlands, I have a background in art and fullstack development.

In early 2000's I used to use Flash MX for animating and developing games, and from there I found an interest in developing Flash websites.

From mid 2000's, I started my career as a fullstack developer using HTML, CSS and PHP. I continued this as a freelancer for about a decade.

Around 2016, I decided to focus my career on the front-end. I draw and I'm a visual human being after all.

In 2022 I moved to the Netherlands.

In my personal life, I enjoy cycling and kayaking. I like history and cinema, and with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I'm an IoT hobbyist.
