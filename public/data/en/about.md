Born in Iran and now a Skilled Migrant in the Netherlands, I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with a background in art and full-stack development.

My journey began with Flash MX, where I explored animation and game development before transitioning to Flash websites. Over time, I expanded into full-stack development, working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. However, my passion for design, interactivity, and user experience naturally led me to specialize in frontend engineering.

Beyond coding, I enjoy cycling and kayaking, diving into history and cinema, and experimenting with IoT projects, drawing from my Electrical Engineering degree.
